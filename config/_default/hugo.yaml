    content: |
      üëãüèº I'm Skyler, a Senior Software Engineer with a recent focus on backend architecture. I work primarily in TypeScript. I work across disciplines; we are all pushing for the same goal. I thrive when mentoring and empowering engineers to do their best work as we solve complex problems together.

      I am also an endurance athlete, having cycled over 10,000km in 2024. As an openly trans and neurodivergent human, my writing is informed by my intersectional identity navigating the world. I passionately engage in universal design discussions across many aspects of life, including work.
