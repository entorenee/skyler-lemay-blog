I look in the mirror and wonder\
How can so little be done\
Such chaotic discord shifting my gaze\
At every chance it can

Government proposes rule to strip away care\
From me and my community\
Reducing to acknowledge that gender affirming care\
Applies to them just as much as it does to me

But work calls the next dayOne must contribute to the machine to survive\
You can focus on this right?!\
Collapse one hits the stage

Pass out crying in bedWondering how this timeline can be real\
Wake up, force myself to eat\
Call congressional representatives\
Trying to help my community survive

Who knows what happened the next few days\
The cycles of life an ongoing blur\
Through joyous moments of cuddlesI grasp onto my queer joy\
Breathing life into this dystopian world

Overcommitted. Frazzled.\
Another prime source of joy and balance\
Forcibly removed for an unknown time\
Impacted by steel and cement\
Just collapse. What else can one do?

The morning is wet with morning mist\
Replicated across my cheeks\
The overfilling of the cups from yesterday\
Still not drained enough\
Getting out of bed\
Already adds too much to the cup

Do I go for a run and hope I can bounce back\
Or maybe I can just make it through the day\
My emotional poker face is shit\
A run it is\
Do what it takes to survive

More complexities and little joys\
Excited for some plans\
Thwarted by another random asshole\
Transphobia? Misogyny? Car entitlement?\
Who knows, but it hits hard regardless\
Another change. Another dysregulation.

Oh that Autism. Sometimes she's great\
As long as the various forms of overwhelm\
Stay relatively in their proper place.\
Otherwise good luck on executive function\
Unless it's a dopamine mine to help sustain you.

It's ok. Sometimes weeks are just rough.\
Those seem to be happening a lot.\
Time to cobble up those pieces of joy\
Nourish the soul in preparation\
Of surviving the week that lies ahead
