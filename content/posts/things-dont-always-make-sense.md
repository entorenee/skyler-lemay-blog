Things don't always make sense. People are impacted by painful circumstances differently. They manifest in different ways. Our communities still come together.

We create space for each other. We don't rank trauma. We recharge in our solidarity, and we keep on pushing forward. It's how we survive. It's how we begin to thrive.

It's not fair at all. Things don't always make sense. We are still stronger together. We can't let them tear that away from us.
