The Linked List is a collection of interesting articles that I have recently read and found beneficial. Today's links cover web accessibility, upcoming features to ECMAScript, breaking down imperative vs declarative programming, and why your GraphQL APIs should embrace nullability.

- [When Is A Button Not A Button?](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/02/buttons-interfaces/): Buttons have a number of built in accessibility and user interactions built in. Learn more and the dangers of trying to substitute other elements for buttons.
- [Optional Chaining in JavaScript](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining/blob/master/README.md): This past week optional chaining entered stage 3 for TC 39 consideration. This syntax enables cleaner code for drilling without a bunch of `&&` type guards. Check out the full proposal at the link above. If youâ€™re interested in trying it out use the [Babel plugin](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-proposal-optional-chaining).
- [Nullability in GraphQL](https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/nullability-in-graphql-b8d06fbd8a3c): Embracing nullability early on helps with the flexibility of your API, optimistic UI, avoiding breaking changes, and much more. Read more about how fields should only be made non-nullable with great intention.
- [Imperative vs Declarative Programming](https://tylermcginnis.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/): This Article by Tyler McGinnis is by far the clearest explanation of the difference between imperative and declarative programming I have read. Complete with real world metaphors, and a great place to wrap your head around the topic.
- [The WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/): WebAIM (Web Accessibility in Mind) is a great resource for increasing accessibility on the web. Earlier this year they surveyed one million websites and identified the most common accessibility errors, low hanging fruit, and some correlation amongst errors.
