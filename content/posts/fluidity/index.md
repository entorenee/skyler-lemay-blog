Fluidity\
Unpredictable undercurrents\
Filled with emotions and perspectives\
Don't cling to past assumptions\
Nor assume that the present is final

Water evaporates\
Condenses and accumulates\
Before renewing the Earth\
With her gift of life\
There are so many manifestations\
Nonetheless they remain water

Life's experiences are vast\
Not easily contained or defined\
When given a new perspective\
Do we remain stoic\
Refusing to adapt\
Constantly seeking to control\
Or do we examine the current\
And see where it takes us next
