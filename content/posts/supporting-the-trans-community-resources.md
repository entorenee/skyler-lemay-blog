> In a male-centered gender hierarchy, where it is assumed that men are better than women and that masculinity is superior to femininity, there is no greater perceived threat than the existence of trans women, who despite being born male and inheriting male privilege "choose" to be female instead. By embracing our own femaleness and femininity, we, in a sense, cast a shadow of doubt over the supposed supremacy of maleness and masculinity.

I recently put together this list of resources for a discussion with people wanting to know more about the struggles that I, and more broadly the trans community, are dealing with at the moment. The intention of this list and post is to provide a starting point for those desiring to dig more into how they can support the trans people in their lives. It is also important to highlight that [Marsha P. Johnson and Silvia Rivera ](https://historynavigator.org/2020/06/15/marsha-p-johnson-and-sylvia-rivera-activists/)were at the forefront of the LGBTQ rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s with the former being credited as the person who started the rebellion at Stonewall in June 1969. Both were trans women of colorâ€”a group which [experiences disproportionately high levels of discrimination and violence](https://theconversation.com/transgender-people-of-color-face-unique-challenges-as-gender-discrimination-and-racism-intersect-179515). 

A few disclaimers and points of perspective:

* This list is by no means exhaustive. My intention is to provide details on overall themes as well as some resources for people to look into further.
* Along those lines, I acknowledge that this list is informed by my experiences as a privileged trans woman. Many of the items are general, and I have specifically called out some resources which speak to trans masculine and non-binary experiences. Many thanks as well to the individuals who reviewed earlier iterations of this document, provided feedback, and have recommended some of items below to me. I appreciate our friendship and open discussion. ðŸ’œ
* Several portions of this post will be uncomfortable and political. I would love for my existence to not be politically sensationalized, but that is unfortunately not the world I live in. I have elected not to dilute some of the really uncomfortable sections to make this more palpable.
* I've shared more about my own perspectives of increasing [queer solidarity through consciously choosing to be visible](queer-solidarity-and-the-impact-of-visibility-tanking). This is a personal decision of each individual. My overall openness should not be construed or applied to trans folx as a whole.
## How to Take Action

### Support the trans people in your life

- **Check in on them**â€”we are often not ok.
- **See if there are ways you can support them.**
- **Do your research** and don't expect them to be your trans google. There is a lot of emotional labor associated with that.
- **Every trans person has different levels of how open they are** with varying aspects of their transition. Err on the side of caution, and definitely don't ask invasive questions.
- **Absolutely DO NOT ask them about anything to do with surgeries.** Would you ask a cisgender person if they were planning to have a surgery?
    - This is incredibly invasive and personal. It is reductive to our existence and adds to the sensationalism of our existence.
    - If a trans person has initiated or shared information about surgery (either past or present), it may be ok to discuss but again approach with caution and don't pry.

### Be aware of the issues trans people are experiencing

- **Acknowledge the points of intersectionality.** Engage in that process.
- **Things for introspection:**
    - How do attacks on trans women impact women as a whole?
    - What are the threats to women's safety, equity, etc?
    - How do various narratives and logic work out when acknowledging the existence of trans men? Of non-binary people? Of intersex people?
    - Who benefits and drives many of the conversations around defining womanhood? How does that interplay with oppositional sexism, traditional sexism, and misogyny?
    - How does the erosion of civil rights for a smaller group of individuals influence future attacks on other marginalized groups?
    - Audre Lorde said, "I am not free while any woman is unfree, even when her shackles are very different from my own. And I am not free as long as one person of Color remains chained." How does that inform your perspective of intersectionality?
- **Shoulder the emotional labor** by increasing the overall awareness and urgent need of the trans community with cisgender circles.

### Advocate

- **Show up to local sessions attacking the trans community**
- **Local and state politics** are driving much of the worst levels of legislation. It's also where individuals have greater agency.
- **Talk to your federal representatives**
    - (202) 224-3121 US Government Dashboard to connect you with representatives' offices
    - Call and talk with the representative's staff to share concerns and impacts you see on current legislation.
    - Call out representatives who are not getting involved or speaking up about what is happening
    - Discuss issues you see stemming from actions at the federal, state, and local levels.
    - Include intersectional reflection that you have engaged in and why these concerns transcend the trans community
